# movie-recommendation-tool 
This is a tool to help people choose movies based on their preferences.

## Inspiration
I, like many others, enjoy a good movie. However, when it comes time for my friends and I to pick a movie, we can't decide and end up just watching YouTube instead. Since we're college students, all we have access to is Hulu and Netflix and so just searching online for movies isn't helpful as we may not be able to watch it on Hulu or Netflix.

I decided to build a tool that helps solve this problem for us, so my friends and I can spend more time having fun rather than stressing out.

## Description
To use the tool, simply input your movie watching preferences, and hit submit. Once you hit submit, a list of movies available for you to watch will appear, along with their descriptions, movie posters, ratings, and release dates.

## Instructions
To run this project,

1. `git clone https://github.com/eeshangarr/movie-recommendation-tool.git`
2.  Open the cloned folder in any environment of your choice.
4.  Now, you will need to open a terminal:
    - `py/python3 -m flask run`. (Hint: If you're on Windows, use `py`. If you're on MacOS, use `python3`.)
5. Go to your browser and open `localhost:5000` to view the project!
